# battery_spy
A little flutter app that sends an UDP broadcast when the battery state changes from charging to discharging or the opposite. It can also be configured to listen to such broadcast and display a notification. Can be used on android devices (4.1 +). I leave the use cases to your imagination ðŸ˜‰
